Step1 notes:

Here the initial proteomic datasets are processed to create a series of datafiles where missing values have been replaced according to various rules.

'dataRaw' is used in subsequent analyses as reference dataset
'dataAtlasPC' is the preferred derived dataset where the missing values rules include consideration of expression profile in the Protein Atlas.
